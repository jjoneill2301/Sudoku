## Overview:
  This is an application I have been building to help me explore Java Swing so I can improve my comfort with designing GUI's. It was my final project for my Java programming class at STCC,
however I am still actively maintaining this repository because building it has continued to prove itself as really rewarding. You will see a few files in the project, but some of them were from the beginning stages
when I was still testing via the console. 
### If you would like to see the beginning processes of me making this, the early files you will need are as follows:
   1. [Main.java (Run this)](https://github.com/jjoneill2301/Sudoku/blob/master/src/Main.java)
   2. [SudokuBoard.java](https://github.com/jjoneill2301/Sudoku/blob/master/src/SudokuBoard.java)

In SudokuBoard.java, I didn't really know how to tackle difficulty and you will see that it is a 0-1 slider for difficulty. This both seems and is confusing, as it fails to consistently 
generate puzzles with equal levels of difficulty and scales in a way that would be hard to decide on different preset difficulties for the user to choose from.

### Current Version:
   1. [Cell.java](https://github.com/jjoneill2301/Sudoku/blob/master/src/Cell.java)
   2. [SudokuBoardWithCells.java](https://github.com/jjoneill2301/Sudoku/blob/master/src/SudokuBoardWithCells.java)
   3. [SudokUI.java (Run this)](https://github.com/jjoneill2301/Sudoku/blob/master/src/SudokUI.java)
